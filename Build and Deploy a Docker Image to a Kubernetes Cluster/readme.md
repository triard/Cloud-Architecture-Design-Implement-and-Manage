<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>For this Challenge Lab you must complete a series of tasks within a limited time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and task - you figure out how to to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.</p>

<h1>Your challenge</h1>
<p>To test the deployment, you need to download the sample application, then build the Docker container image using a tag that allows it to be stored on the Container Registry. Once the image has been built, you'll push it out to the Container Registry before you can deploy it.</p>
<p>With the image prepared you can then create a Kubernetes cluster, then deploy the sample application to the cluster.</p>
